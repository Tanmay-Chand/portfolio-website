                <p>Hello, I am Ajay Tripathi. I am 21 years old, born and raised in India. I am currently working to complete my bachelors in Computer Science. I love engineering my way out of problems. I have the love of thinking and often find myself flirting with branches of philosophy like existentialism & stoicism. I believe the world to be a positive sum game and hence promote and proudly contribute to the open-source culture.</p>
                <p>I love to meet and understand people and what drives them, and to do the same efficiently, i fancy myself with the study of body language, human psychology, personalities and emotions.</p>
                <p>I support the society by helping people gain access to education & information. I mentor students in my college and contribute to OpenWISP to achieve these all goals.</p>
                <p>Amongst the hottest debates where i partake in, I am a strong supporter of net neutrality & right to privacy. I am available on the internet with the username <b>atb00ker</b>. Feel free to reach me on Twitter or LinkedIn or head on the "Timeline" feature to find out more about my recent activities.</p>
